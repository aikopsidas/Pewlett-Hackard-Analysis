# Pewlett Hackard, this ain't no Sicromoft

## Overview: 
A tidlewave of retirement is approaching, a "Silver Tsunami" as Roberts manager calls it, and we need to prepare for his onslaught of silver fox staff calsulties. To prepear Bobbies manager has asked us to review our employee roster and find and nail down two things.
### The Ask:
1. The number of employees set to retire
2. Those employees that are eligable to participate in a mentorship program

With our new mad skills at SQL this was a complete cake-walk. 

## Results:
### Employees Set to Retire 
  - Bob's manager was not wrong, at this very moment we have 72,458 employees gathering in a wave that will crush the coast of our business

  - To top it off, we are losing a hurricane of knowledge with 25,916 Senior Engineers poised to retire (that's is 36% of our soon to be retirees!).
