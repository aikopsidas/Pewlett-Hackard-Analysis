## Overview: 
A tidlewave of retirement is approaching, a "Silver Tsunami" as Roberts manager calls it, and we need to prepare for his onslaught of silver fox staff calsulties. To prepear Bobbies manager has asked us to review our employee roster and find and nail down two things.
### The Ask:
1. The number of employees set to retire
2. Those employees that are eligable to participate in a mentorship program

## Results:
